            <p align="justify">Maren was born outside Chicago on October 12, 1980 and moved  to the San Diego suburb of Santee in 1984.   She attended Hill Creek Elementary and Cajon Park Elementary.  Maren played Basketball and Tennis and  participated in Student Government and Yearbook while attending Santana High  School, graduating in 1998.  After four  years in the Bay Area, she graduated from the University of California Berkeley  with a degree in Rhetoric and Film Studies.   After spending one more year in Berkeley, Maren moved back to San Diego,  continuing her college job with Landmark Theatres.  After three years running the Hillcrest  Cinemas, Maren accepted a move to the DC area to work at the Bethesda Row Cinema.</p>
        	<p align="justify">Matthieu was born in Paris on August 3, 1976.  Growing up in the Twelfth Quarter between  Bastille and Nation, Matt enjoyed passing time in the streets of Paris on  roller blades and riding bikes.  He attended  the College Vincent d’Indy and the professional High School Marcel Deprez,  before spending a year at Sehome High School in Bellingham, Washington in 1994.  Matt went on to work as a swim coach, life  guard and synchronized swimming coach at various swimming clubs in Paris,  including the French Swimming Federation.  His love for swimming led him on a trip to the  1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and his love for America led him to accept a  position as nanny in Hyattsville, Maryland in 2003.  After a year in Maryland, Matt returned to  France and spent a year in Ars-en-Re, enjoying a continued relationship with  the Centre Nautique de Plein Air (sailing school), before returning to the DC  area to study Forensics at Marymount University.  A year into his program, Matt took a job at  the Bethesda Row Cinema.</p>
            <p align="justify">Maren and Matthieu met while working together at the  Bethesda Row Cinema.  Maren’s subsequent move  to Atlanta and Matt’s return to France cemented their affection for each other.  With the couple now together in Atlanta, Matt  met Maren’s mother in December 2007 and in July 2008, Matt asked permission for  a proposal.  At the end of July, they  took a trip to France, visiting Paris and Ars-en-Re so Maren could meet Matt’s  family.  Heading home on Matt’s birthday,  they stopped in Paris for the night and took a walk around the city.  While Maren suspected a proposal at the  Eiffel Tower, Matt had other plans.   Taking a walk along the Seine, Matt steered them towards the Louvre and  the Point des Arts.  In the middle of the  bridge, Matt stopped Maren to look across the river.  He began to describe a scene from the end of <em>Sex and the City</em> when Mr. Big finds  Carrie on the bridge and tells her “she’s the one.”  Getting down on one knee in the same spot the  scene took place, Matt asked Maren to marry him, and she said, “yes, now get  up, people are looking.”</p>
